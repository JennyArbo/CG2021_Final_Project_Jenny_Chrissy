# Executive Summary

## Background

An agency of the Department of the Interior, the US National Park Service has a history dating back to 1872, when President Grant signed an act on March 1st establishing Yellowstone as the country's first national park.  Captivated by nature since childhood, Theodore Roosevelt led several conservation initiatives during his presidency, including the 1906 Antiquities Act.  Congress offered its support in 1916 by passing the so-called Organic Act, which officially established the National Park Service.  Other significant landmarks in the NPS chronology include the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which is perhaps the best-known in a series of 1960s/70s environmental legislation that elevated the importance of research and scientific study in the national parks.

In its capacity as a conservation-focused federal agency, the National Park Service publishes and maintains publicly available data on the flora and fauna present in its 63 established parks.  This information is offered via the online tool NPSpecies, hosted on the Department of the Interior's IRMA (Integrated Resource Management Applications) portal (https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/).  The dataset we utilized in this project is drawn from the NPS database and hosted on Kaggle under the name "Biodiversity in National Parks" (https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity).  It comprises two subsets: parks.csv, which provides location and size information for 56 national parks; and species.csv, which offers 119,248 unique entries for plants, animals, and other organisms that reside within the bounds of those 56 national parks.

## Project Motivation

According to the National Park Service website, an estimated 80-90% of species who call our national parks "home" have yet to be discovered.  In light of factors such as climate change and pollution, the populations of these unknown species may become threatened or even extinct if no action is taken.  The data that has been collected on known park species can be used as a sample on which to base conservation efforts.  By determining which types of habitats and organisms are least common in our parks and perhaps most in danger of disappearing, conservation efforts can be objectively prioritized, allocating funding and other resources to where they are most needed.

The preservation of natural spaces and their ecosystems should not only concern folks who enjoy hiking and camping in them - their continued existence afffects all of us.  Threats to biodiversity can have ripple effect that ultimately impact humans and our livelihood.  By working to preserve these systems now, we can mitigate and potentially eliminate future risks, leading to better outcomes all around.  Responsible management of resources using an evidence-based approach, with an eye to creative and doable solutions, can preserve these resources for future generations and make measurable progress towards sustainable solutions.
